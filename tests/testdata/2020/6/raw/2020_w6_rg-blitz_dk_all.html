This metric includes quarterbacks.</p></div><div class="legend-col"> <h3> <strong>D Stuffed</strong> (Defensive Line Stuffed Rate)</h3> <p>The percentage of runs where the running back is tackled at or behind the line of scrimmage by the opposing team. Since being stuffed is so bad, a higher number here is better for the defense.</p></div><div class="legend-col"> <h3> <strong>ProdPrem</strong> (Production Premium)</h3> <p>This metric isolates the player’s situation-agnostic efficiency. Production Premium compares the outcome of all pass attempts, carries and targets to league-average outcomes in those same game situations (yard line, down and distance).

Also referred to as average throw depth.</p></div><div class="legend-col"> <h3> <strong>DeepAttRk</strong> (Deep Ball Attempts Rank)</h3> <p>This metric charts the total number of passing attempts that travel 20 yards or farther in the air. This metric is a window into the vertically-oriented nature of a quarterback’s offensive system.
